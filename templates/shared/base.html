                <p>This policy applies to Ticketless.io, our platform services, and any tools or integrations used to process event data and attendee information. It covers both event organizers who use our service and attendees who purchase tickets through Ticketless-supported events.</p>

                <h5>What is personal information?</h5>
                <p>Personal information refers to any data that identifies an individual, including names, contact details, payment information, event attendance data, or device identifiers collected when interacting with our platform.</p>

                <h5>What if you don’t want us to collect your personal information?</h5>
                <p>Certain information is required for processing tickets and granting event access. Opting out may result in limited or denied access to events or platform services. You may request deletion of your data after the event unless regulatory retention applies.</p>
